# PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project, I will be using a keystroke dataset from Aalto University with over 136 million rows of data contributed by 168,000 participants in an online study. Participants were required to memorize some English sentences and then asked to type them as quickly and accurately as they could. These sentences were randomly selected from a set of 1,525 examples with 3 words and 70 characters maximum. Subjects could type more than 70 characters because there is a chance that participants would forget words or add new characters when typing.

Below are the questions this project will attempt to answer:
<ul>
    <li>What is the typing speed (WPM - word per minute) of each of the 168,000 participants? </li>
    <li>Can participants be grouped by their typing speed as either below average, average, fast or genious typer?</li>
    <li>How long does it take to type each character?</li>
    <li>Are there characters or combination of characters (digraphs - two characters; trigraphs - three characters) that that are faster or slower for each user? These characters or combination of characters can help differentiate users.
</ul>
